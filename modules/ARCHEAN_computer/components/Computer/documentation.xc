; Basic Declarations
var $num_value : number
const $speed_of_light = 299792458

; Storage Declarations
storage var $memorized_value : number
storage array $memorized_names : text
; Storage values are retained between reboots and program modifications. They are always default-initialized to 0 or empty.

init
	; This entry point is executed once when the program is loaded.
	; Only one 'init' entry point may be defined in a program.

shutdown
	; This entry point is executed once when the computer is powered off or before it is rebooted (but NOT when it crashes).
	; Multiple 'shutdown' entry points may be defined in a single program and they will all be executed in the order they are defined.

input.0 ($value0:number, $value1:number, $value2:text)
	; This entry point is executed whenever a value is received from the input with the specified IO index.
	; The arguments are the values received for each channel. Any number of arguments can be provided, with their appropriate types.
	; There can only be one 'input' entry point defined per IO index per program.

click ($x:number, $y:number)
	; This entry point is executed whenever a user clicks on the screen, given an xy coordinate in pixels.
	; Multiple 'click' entry points may be defined in a single program and they will all be executed in the order they are defined.

tick
	; This entry point is executed once every server tick.
	; Only one 'tick' entry point may be defined in a program.

timer interval 5
	; This entry point is executed every 5 seconds.
	; Multiple 'timer interval' entry points may be defined in a single program and they will all be executed as their time has come, after the tick.
timer frequency 10
	; This entry point is executed 10 times per second.
	; Multiple 'timer frequency' entry points may be defined in a single program and they will all be executed as their time has come, after the tick.
	
update
	; This entry point is executed on each server tick at the end of each cycle, after the timers.
	; Multiple 'update' entry points may be defined in a single program and they will all be executed in the order they are defined.

	; Built-in values
	$num_value = time ; the current time as decimal unix timestamp in seconds with microsecond precision
	$num_value = delta_time ; the time interval between ticks in seconds (equivalent to 1.0 / system_frequency)
	$num_value = tick ; the index of the current tick since the computer has started
	
	$num_value = char_w ; the width of a character in pixels, taking into consideration the current text size
	$num_value = char_h ; the height of a character in pixels, taking into consideration the current text size

	$num_value = screen_w ; the width of the virtual monitor in pixels
	$num_value = screen_h ; the height of the virtual monitor in pixels

	$num_value = clicked ; whether the mouse button was pressed while aiming at the virtual monitor
	$num_value = click_x ; the x coordinate of the mouse cursor on the virtual monitor when the mouse button was pressed
	$num_value = click_y ; the y coordinate of the mouse cursor on the virtual monitor when the mouse button was pressed
	
	$num_value = system_frequency ; the frequency of the system clock in hertz (ticks per second)
	$num_value = programs_count ; the number of programs currently on the virtual HDD
	
	$num_value = pi ; 3.14159265.....
	$num_value = 2pi ; 3.14159265 * 2
	
	
	; Built-in functions
	var $programName = program_name(0) ; returns a program name, given an index between 0 and programs_count-1
	load_program($programName) ; loads a program and call its init function (it first unloads the currently running program, calling shutdown on it)
	reboot() ; reboots the computer (calls the shutdown entry point and loads the bios or main program)
	
	; Random Generator
	$num_value = random(0, 100) ; returns a random integer value between 0 and 100 inclusively
	$num_value = random ; returns a random float value between 0.0 and 1.0 (hitting exactly 0.0 or 1.0 is statistically improbable)
	
	
	; IO
	
	; input_[number|text](aliasOrIoNumber, channelIndex) ; returns the value of the input with the given alias and index
	var $someNumber = input_number("", 0)
	var $someText = input_text("", 0)
	
	; output_[number|text](aliasOrIoNumber, channelIndex, value) ; sends the given value to the output with the given alias and index
	output_number(0, 0, $num_value) ; send a number to output with alias computer
	output_number("computer", 0, $num_value) ; send a number to output with alias computer
	output_text("computer", 0, "hello") ; send text hello to output with alias computer

	
	; Color
	var $blue = color(0, 0, 255) ; returns an RGB color given three values between 0 and 255. This will always assume full opacity (as if 255 is passed in the a component).
	var $translucentRed = color(255, 0, 0, 128) ; returns an RGBA color given four values between 0 and 255. A value of 128 in the a component will effectively be 50% opacity. 0 would mean transparent.
	var $redComponent = color_r($translucentRed) ; is effectively the reverse of the previous function to get back the 255 value. Same can be done with color_g, color_b and color_a.

	; Built-in colors
	var $black = black
	var $white = white
	var $red = red
	var $green = green
	var $blue = blue
	var $yellow = yellow
	var $pink = pink
	var $orange = orange
	var $cyan = cyan
	var $gray = gray
	var $purple = purple
	var $brown = brown
	
	
	; Screen Rendering functions (draw on a virtual screen)
	
	blank($black) ; clears the screen with a given color

	write(0, 0, green, "Hello") ; write a green Hello message in the top left corner of the screen
	write(0, char_h, blue, "Hey") ; write a blue Hey message just under the first message
	; Note that char_w and char_h return the size of one character in pixels + 1 additional pixel, to serve as a multiplier to jump lines or to count the width of a text.

	text_size(2) ; sets text size to two times native, only valid for following writes in the current cycle until the next call to text_size()

	; Draw functions take positions X and Y where 0,0 = top-left, in pixels.
	; draw_point(x, y, color)
	draw_point(screen_w/2, screen_h/2, white) ; draw a single white pixel in the middle of the screen
	; draw_line(x1, y1, x2, y2, color)
	draw_line(0, 0, screen_w, screen_h, yellow) ; draw a yellow line going from top left to bottom right of the screen
	; draw_rect(x1, y1, x2, y2, color [, fillcolor])
	draw_rect(50, 50, 60, 60, red) ; draw a red square starting at coordinates 50,50 inclusive through 60,60 exclusive, it will effectively have a size of 10x10.
	; draw_triangle(x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, color [, fillcolor])
	draw_triangle(screen_w/2, 0, 0, screen_h, screen_w, screen_h, blue) ; draw a blue triangle from the top middle to the bottom corners of the screen
	; draw_circle(x, y, radius, color [, fillcolor])
	draw_circle(screen_w/2, screen_h/2, 50, green) ; draw a green circle with a radius of 50 pixels in the middle of the screen
	
	; Draw functions may also be turned into Buttons. Works with rect, triangle and circle.
	if button_rect(0, 0, 40, 10, gray) ; draw a gray rectangle button in the top left corner of the screen. Evaluates to true if clicked.
		if user == owner
			print("The owner of this computer clicked the button")
		else
			print("The button was clicked by " & user) ; prints a message to the console (when the button was clicked, in this case)
	; Here we also happen to use the built-ins 'user' and 'owner' which are player usernames
	
	var $somePixelColor = pixel(10, 10) ; get the current color of the pixel at coordinates 10,10
	
	; For rendering to external screens, you may define a screen object and call any of the above Screen Rendering functions.
	; The screen() constructor takes in two arguments 0 or two arguments. If no arguments are provided, it will refer to the computer's screen, if available.
	; The arguments are ioNumber and channelIndex.
	var $dash = screen(0,1) ; declare a screen plugged into port 0 using the channel 1
	$dash.draw_circle($dash.width/2, $dash.height/2, 50, green) ; draw a green circle with a radius of 50 pixels in the middle of the external screen
	; Note that screen_w and screen_h are now width and height respectively. Everything else is the same.
